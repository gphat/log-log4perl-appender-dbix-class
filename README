NAME
    Log::Log4perl::Appender::DBIx::Class - appender for DBIx::Class

SYNOPSIS
      my $dbic_appender = Log::Log4perl::Appender->new(
        'Log::Log4perl::Appender::DBIx::Class',
        schema => $schema,
        class => 'Message',
      );

      $log->add_appender($dbic_appender);

      $log->error('Hello!');

DESCRIPTION
    This is a specialized Log4perl appender that allows you to log to with
    DBIx::Class. Each appender can use a different (or the same) class and
    each column is configurable.

    Note: I wanted this module to operate on an already connected schema,
    hence it's lack of a config file example. If you want to use it in such
    a way, patches are welcome!

PARAMETERS
    These can be supplied to Appender's `new' method.

    class
        The resultset class to use for logging. Defaults to 'Log'.

    category_column
        The column in which to store the Log4perl category. Defaults to
        'category'.

    level_column
        The column in which to store the Log4perl level. Defaults to
        'level'.

    message_column
        The column in which to store the Log4perl message. Defaults to
        'message'. In case you are wondering (I was), this column WILL
        received the formatted message as defined by the appender's layout.

    other_columns
        This parameter allows you to pass in an arrayref of arbitrary column
        names. At the time the row is created, this arrayref will be
        iterated over and any column names will be set:

          foreach my $col (@{ $self->{column_names}}) {
              $row->$col($self->{$col});
          }
  
        This allows you to specificy arbitrary options when you create the
        appender and have the logged in any rows created. An example is in
        order:

          my $appender = Log::Log4perl::Appender->new(
              'Log::Log4perl::Appender::DBIx::Class',
              schema => $schema,
              class => 'Message',
              user => 'someuser',
              other_columns => [qw(user)]
          );
  
        This will cause any Message objects that are logged to have their
        `user' column set to 'someuser'.
